coinop-py: python crypto currency conveniences


coinop-py is still beta code but is in active development. Bug reports and
patches welcome.


Installing coinop-py:

0. Install libsodium

1. Install a python 2.7 environment (the nicest way to do this is with pyenv
   and virtualenv).  It is developed under 2.7.7, and while it may work with
   earlier versions that is currently untested. The goal is compatibility with
   at least the 2.7 and perhaps the 2.6 series. If those versions don't fit
   your needs drop us a line and we can talk about it.

2. Install a C build environment if you don't already have one: you'll need gcc
   (Debian/Ubuntu: gcc) and make (make)

3. Install the python C extension libraries: libpython (libpython-all-dev),
   libffi (libffi-dev)

4. Make sure you've installed pip (Ubuntu: python-pip), or at least setuptools
   (python-setuptools) if you only plan to work from the git repository.

5. Either: install coinop from PyPI:

    $ pip install coinop

   Or: install from the github repo (https://github.com/BitVault/coinop-py) and
   run 'python setup.py install' ('python setup.py develop' if you plan to work
   on the codebase yourself).
